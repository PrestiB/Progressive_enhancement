      <h2>The story</h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
        evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
        <q>
          We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
          unfortunate.</q
        >
        The farmer said, <q><em> Maybe </em>.</q> The next day the horse came
        back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody
        came back and said,
        <q
          >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
          horses!</q
        >
        The farmer again said, <q><em> Maybe </em>.</q> The following day his
        son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown
        and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
        <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad</q> and the farmer responded,
        <q><em> Maybe </em>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came
        around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
        because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and
        said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><em> Maybe </em>.</q>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
        complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
        happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the
        consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
        consequences of good fortune. Alan Watts

      Conclusion
      <q>
        Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of
        it...</q
